![Job Application Platform](/images/se-randstad.png)

An integrated platform for Randstad Japan designed to streamline applications for short-term and one-off jobs. The system comprises a mobile app for job seekers and a web portal for internal staff, built using the **OutSystems low-code platform** with SQL Server. I contributed to both front-end and back-end development: on the mobile app, I contributed to the Calendar page to manage user schedules and the Search page to support job discovery; on the web portal, I was responsible for the Booking Management module and developed REST APIs to enable synchronization with external systems.

A custom-built stock management **web application** for eXpressTyres, a tire sales and delivery company. Developed using **Laravel (PHP)** and MySQL, the system manages inventory tracking, order processing, and user administration. As the sole developer, I was responsible for the entire solutionâ€”from designing the database schema and building backend logic to crafting the user interface and deploying the application to production.

### Golf Booking Platform

![Golf Booking Platform](/images/se-golf.png)

A dual-platform solution consisting of a **web and Android mobile app** for browsing and booking golf tee times. The web app was developed with **Laravel (PHP)**, while the mobile app was built natively using **Java**. I worked on key user-facing features across both platforms, including the Search and Booking modules on the web, and the Search and Favorites pages on the mobile app, helping enhance the user experience and streamline the reservation process.
