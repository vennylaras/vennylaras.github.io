### National Priority Data

National Priority Data (Data Prioritas) are **annually designated datasets aligned with national development indicators**, as mandated by Presidential Regulation No. 39/2019. I worked on ensuring these critical indicators were measurable by cleaning and analyzing data from strategic planning documents like the RPJMN, RKP, and SDGs, and conducted cross-ministry data consolidation to assess and report on dataset availability. The resulting insights supported the government’s efforts in tracking development outcomes and building a foundation for **evidence-based policymaking** at the national level.

Indeks Satu Data Indonesia (Indeks SDI) is a **national evaluation framework designed to measure the implementation of Satu Data Indonesia** across ministries, institutions, and local governments. I contributed to this project by formulating evaluation indicators and scoring criteria, designing the index calculation formula, and conducting AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) to determine indicator weights. I was also actively involved in the evaluation process—supporting socialization efforts, verifying submitted scores, conducting data analysis, and presenting the results to stakeholders as part of national monitoring and improvement efforts.

### AI Presentation Coach

2022 | *Capstone Project, CMU*

![AI Presentation Coach](/images/data-aipc1.png)

An end-to-end AI-powered system designed to **assess presentation skills in Zoom-style environments** by analyzing video recordings and slide decks. The system scores presentations across multiple dimensions such as clarity, fluency, and legibility, and delivers personalized, actionable feedback to presenters. My role focused on training the machine learning models responsible for evaluating slide-related metrics and handling the integration of model outputs with the front-end interface.

### Machine Translation for Indonesian Languages

2022 | *Multilingual NLP Final Project, CMU*

![Machine Translation for Indonesian Languages](/images/data-mnlp.png)

A group project focused on building **machine translation models for low-resource Indonesian languages**: Sundanese, Javanese, and Minangkabau. Existing solutions for these languages typically relied on large monolingual corpora or simple word-to-word mappings. To address this gap, we fine-tuned pre-trained neural translation models using techniques like domain knowledge transfer and data augmentation through backtranslation. I was involved in model selection, fine-tuning, and error analysis, with a focus on improving accuracy for linguistically rich but underrepresented languages.

### Movie Recommendation System

2022 | *ML in Production Group Project, CMU*

![Movie Recommendation System](/images/data-mlprod.png)

A **scalable movie recommendation system** designed to handle **real-time user watch data**. We implemented a collaborative filtering approach tailored for implicit feedback datasets and deployed the model behind a RESTful API. I was responsible for training and tuning the recommendation model, as well as setting up monitoring and visualization using Grafana, ensuring the system could track performance and user engagement metrics effectively.
