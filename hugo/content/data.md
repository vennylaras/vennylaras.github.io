### AI Presentation Coach

2022 | *Capstone Project, CMU*

![AI Presentation Coach](/images/data-aipc1.png)

An end-to-end AI-powered system designed to **assess presentation skills in Zoom-style environments** by analyzing video recordings and slide decks. The system scores presentations across multiple dimensions such as clarity, fluency, and legibility, and delivers personalized, actionable feedback to presenters. My role focused on training the machine learning models responsible for evaluating slide-related metrics and handling the integration of model outputs with the front-end interface.


### Machine Translation for Indonesian Languages

2022 | *Multilingual NLP Final Project, CMU*

A group project focused on building **machine translation models for low-resource Indonesian languages**: Sundanese, Javanese, and Minangkabau. Existing solutions for these languages typically relied on large monolingual corpora or simple word-to-word mappings. To address this gap, we fine-tuned pre-trained neural translation models using techniques like domain knowledge transfer and data augmentation through backtranslation. I was involved in model selection, fine-tuning, and error analysis, with a focus on improving accuracy for linguistically rich but underrepresented languages.


### Movie Recommendation System

2022 | *ML in Production Group Project, CMU*

![Movie Recommendation System](/images/data-mlprod.png)

A **scalable** movie recommendation system designed to handle **real-time user watch data**. We implemented a collaborative filtering approach tailored for implicit feedback datasets and deployed the model behind a RESTful API. I was responsible for training and tuning the recommendation model, as well as setting up monitoring and visualization using Grafana, ensuring the system could track performance and user engagement metrics effectively.
