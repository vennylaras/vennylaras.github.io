*Hello, I'm Venny!* ðŸ‘‹

<img class="avatar" src="images/author.jpeg" alt="avatar">

I'm a data enthusiast with a passion for turning data into insights that drive smarter decisions. Currently, I work as a **Data Analyst** at **Satu Data Indonesia**, a national initiative under the Ministry of National Development Planning that focuses on enhancing interoperability and utilization of government data.

I hold a **Masterâ€™s degree in Computational Data Science** from Carnegie Mellon Universityâ€™s School of Computer Science, where I specialized in Analytics. My time at CMU sharpened my skills in data analysis, machine learning, data visualization, and cloud computing through hands-on coursework and real-world projects. I also earned my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science from Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB), which laid a strong foundation in software development and computational thinking.

Before transitioning into data, I spent over four years as a **Software Engineer**, contributing to a wide range of web and mobile app development projects across different tech stacks. This engineering foundation enables me to approach data problems with both analytical rigor and technical fluency.
